MinGW-w64 is required.

On a Windows system using MSys,
make
make install

For cross-compiling using MinGW on Linux (assuming the MinGW install is beneath /usr):
./crosscomp
make
make install

crosscomp handles setting the CROSS_PREFIX and CPPFLAGS arguments for the target machine.  By default, it assumes a 32-bit target (i686-w64-mingw32), but 64-bit builds (x86_64-w64-mingw32) can be done by using the --arch=64 parameter.  The 64-bit functionality is untested on my part since I have no 64-bit Windows installs to test on.

crosscomp isn't really an adequate solution compared to a regular configure script, but it works for its purpose.
